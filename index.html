I am a Robotics Research Master's student in the <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/'>Robotics Institute </a>, 
<a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science</a>, 
working with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Choset'>Howie Choset</a> and <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/matthew-j-travers/'> Matthew Travers </a>. 
I am  working on deep-learning to optimize autonomous exploration and navigation with limited perception in unknown dynamic/static environments.
<br>
<br>
My interests are in the research and development of intelligent systems and integrated robotics technologies to optimize and improve human life. 
<br>Broadly in  machine learning, computer vision, planning and systems engineering spanning across perception, deep-learning and decision-making.

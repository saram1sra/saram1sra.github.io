I am an accelerated Robotics research <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/'>Master</a> student in the <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/'>Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science</a>, working with by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Choset'>Howie Choset</a> and <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/matthew-j-travers/'> Matthew Travers </a>. I am  working on deep-learning to optimize autonomous exploration and navigation with limited perception in unknown dynamic/static environments.

My interests are in the research and development of intelligent systems and integrated robotics technologies to optimize and improve human life and broadly in  machine learning, computer vision, planning and systems engineering spanning across perception, deep-learning and decision-making
